In this article, we will show you how to download, install and use the KPG-32D software to program your Kenwood radio. Please note that you will also need a programming cable (not included) to connect your radio to your computer. You can purchase the cable separately from Radiotronics UK[^1^] or other authorized Kenwood dealers.
 
## Step 1: Download the KPG-32D Software
 
The KPG-32D software is available as a free download from Radiotronics UK[^1^]. You will need to create an account and log in to access the download link. After you have logged in, go to Your Downloadable Products area of the website and click on the KPG-32D (v1.21) link. You will be asked to confirm your purchase and then you will be able to download the software as a .rar file.
 
## Step 2: Extract and Install the KPG-32D Software
 
After you have downloaded the .rar file, you will need to extract it using a software like WinRAR or 7-Zip. You will get a folder named KPG32D with several files inside. To install the software, you will need to run the SETUP.EXE file and follow the instructions on the screen. You may need to change the compatibility mode of the file to run it on newer operating systems.
 
## Step 3: Connect Your Radio to Your Computer
 
Before you can program your radio, you will need to connect it to your computer using a programming cable. The cable has a serial port connector on one end and a multi-pin connector on the other end that plugs into your radio's accessory port. Make sure your radio is turned off before connecting the cable.

After you have connected the cable, you will need to find out which COM port your computer has assigned to it. You can do this by going to Device Manager and looking for Ports (COM & LPT). You should see something like "Prolific USB-to-Serial Comm Port (COMx)" where x is a number. Note down this number as you will need it later.
 
## Step 4: Run the KPG-32D Software
 
To run the software, you will need to use MS-DOS or DOS-Box. If you are using DOS-Box, you will need to mount the folder where you installed the software as a drive letter. For example, if you installed the software in C:\KPG32D, you can type "mount c c:\kpg32d" in DOS-Box and then type "c:" to switch to that drive.
 
Once you are in the correct drive, type "kpg32d" and press Enter to launch the software. You will see a menu with several options. To program your radio, select "Program" and then "Write Data". You will be asked to enter the COM port number that you noted earlier. Enter it and press Enter.
 
## Step 5: Program Your Radio
 
The software will now try to communicate with your radio. If successful, you will see a message saying "Connected". You will then see a screen with several tabs where you can modify various parameters of your radio. For example, you can change the frequency, tone, power level, etc. of each channel under the "Channel Data" tab.
 
To change a parameter, use the arrow keys or mouse to select it and then press Enter or click on it. You can then enter a new value or choose from a list of options. To save your changes, press F10 or click on "OK". To exit without saving, press Esc or click on "Cancel".
